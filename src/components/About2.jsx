          I finished this 19-week immersive software engineering program in
          August of 2023. This program revolved around project-based learning
          using popular web development frameworks including Django, FastAPI,
          and React. I learned programming fundamentals and studied computer
          science algorithms in Python and Javascript.

          At the moment, I am seeking a role as a full stack engineer. With so
          many skills to practice, my intention is to hone my understanding of
          technology across the stack. I am particularly interested in
          contributing to early stage startups at this phase of my career. My
          dream is for my work to contribute to a safe, clean, and prosperous
          future.{" "}
