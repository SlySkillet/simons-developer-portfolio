        "This is the first application I built from scratch using Django. It is a task manager for a contributors to a project to organize and visualize team progress. This was my first try at implementing a 3rd party api (plotly) and data visualization. I built a full stack application from scratch giving a project manager the ability to assign and monitor progress through a clean user interface with Django 4 framework. I inncorporated gantt charts in the user interface to provide visual representation of project tasks, their due dates and progress towards completion by integrating Plotly API."
