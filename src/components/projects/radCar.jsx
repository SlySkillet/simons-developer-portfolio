        "This was a challenging project I took on in the second module of Hack Reactor. Many thanks to my partner Mac Stephens! Together we put together three microservices to handle an auto-dealership's inventory, services and sales. After completing a functional application, I did some experimenting with the user interface and gained some valuable experience incorporating bootstrap and custom css in React."
