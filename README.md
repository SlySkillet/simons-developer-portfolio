# simons-developer-portfolio

Developer portfolio showcasing my work in Hack Reactor and after. This is meant a site to share important information about my work with employers and colleagues. At the moment, this is meeting my mvp:

- an about page with image, tech stack, and bio
- a projects page displaying projects, their descriptions, screenshots, links to live sites and repositories, and the tech used in the project.
- a resume page displaying my resume with the option to download it to the user's machine
- a contact page with my email, discord, and links to relevant social media

next goals:

- add projects from independent study prior to Hack Reactor
- refactor pages with React best practices
- a blog - dockerize this project and expand it to contain a MongoDB database storing projects and blog posts
- filter functionality for projects and blog posts
