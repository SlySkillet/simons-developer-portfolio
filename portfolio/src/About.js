            <p className="about-content bio">I am a hands-on worker, excited to find creative solutions in software and web development. I am determined to stay on top of new technologies as they surface and evolve. I learn best by putting programming concepts into practice in experimental projects and coding solutions. I tinker with my code, testing and experimenting frequently, to learn the structure of a framework and the under-the-hood functionality of a coding language through the development process. I am persistent in finding solutions to difficult problems and bug fixes. I take the time to research and tap all my available resources to pass a sticking point in development. During this process, I stay open to alternatives and opportunities to refactor in pursuit of clean, effective solutions. </p>
